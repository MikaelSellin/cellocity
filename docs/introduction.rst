Introduction to Cellocity
=========================

A 30 second pitch
-----------------

Cellocity is an bioimage analysis tool for quantifying confluent cell dynamics. The main advantages of Cellocity is its ability work on unlabeled Brightfield time lapse microscopy data, and its tools that both quantify and visualize abstract optical flow based analysis to the user.

Cellocity development history
-----------------------------

Cellocity has been developed over multiple years and several projects. The nucleus was developed at `Stig Ove BÃ¸e's <https://ous-research.no/home/boe/Group+members/10831>`_ research group at Oslo University Hospital and at the `Nanoscopy Gaustad <https://www.med.uio.no/english/research/core-facilities/advanced-light-microscopy-gaustad/>`_ imaging core facility at the University of Oslo. Many of Cellocity's core algorithm implementations and methods, such as the 5-sigma correlation length analysis, were presented in a `Nature Communications <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05578-7>`_ publication in 2018.


Cellocity architecture
----------------------

Cellocity is built on top of  Christoph Gohlke's `Tifffile library <https://pypi.org/project/tifffile/>`_ and uses the ``Tifffile`` object to read input and to write output files. The core element in Cellocity is the ``Channel`` object, which represents one Z-plane of one image channel. ``Channel`` objects also handle image pre-processing, such as temporal or spatial median filtering. ``Channel`` objects are then given as input to ``Analysis`` objects, which perform specific analysis on the data. ``Analysis`` objects can then, in turn, be given to ``Analyzer`` objects, which take care of performing further analysis, such as calculating the alignment index, instantaneous order parameter (:math:`{\psi}`), and correlation length.

Cool algos
----------
 :math:`{\psi}` = 1 corresponds to a perfectly uniform velocity field, where all the cells move in the same direction and with the same speed, while :math:`{\psi}` = 0 is expected for a randomly oriented velocity field. 



Examples
--------

Simple file loading example::

    from cellocity.channel import Channel
    from tiffile import Tiffile

    tif = Tifffile(myFile)
    channel_1 = Channel(0, tif, "channel name") #0-indexed channels

Simple pre-processing example::
    
    channel_1.doTemporalMedianFilter()
    
Simple optical flow calculation example::
    
    from cellocity.analysis import FarenbackAnalyzer
    
    analysis_Ch1 = FarenbackAnalyzer(channel_1, "um/min")
    analysis_Ch1.doFarenbackFlow()
