Validation of the cellocity software
====================================

In order to validate the underlying analyzers in Cellocity, we have generated a “ground truth”, real-world dataset.
This dataset was generated by translating and imaging, with DIC contrast, a fixed monolayer of primary gut epithelium, with free floating debris (as is always present in a live-cell situation), on a high precision linear microscope stage, using a wide selection of magnifications.
The reason for doing so is that optical flow and PIV analysis of transmitted light microscopy time-lapse data is commonly performed in the study of confluent cell layer dynamics phenomena, such as collective cell migration and wound healing.
This is particularly relevant for studies of primary cells, due to the difficulty in reliably labelling these for cell tracking.
To our knowledge, there has not been a evaluation of different pre-processing modalities and optical flow analysis algorithms on real-world non-simulated microscopy data.
