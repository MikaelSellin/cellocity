Contributions are welcome and appreciated, just fork the Github repository an create a `pull request <https://github.com/Oftatkofta/cellocity/pulls>`_. Information on how to do so can be found `here <https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing/blob/master/README.md>`_. Before you do so, please make sure that the documentaion strings are written in reStructuredText so that `Sphinx-autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_ can generate automatic API documentation. It would also be greatly appreciated if the general architecture of ``Channel``, ``Analysis``, and ``Analyzer`` objects is maintained.
