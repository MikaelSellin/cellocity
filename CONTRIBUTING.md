Contributions are welcome and appreciated. Simply fork the GitHub repository and create a [pull request](https://github.com/Oftatkofta/cellocity/pulls). Information on how to do so can be found [here](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing/blob/master/README.md). Before you do so, please make sure that the documentation strings are written in reStructuredText so that [Sphinx-autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) can generate automatic API documentation. It would also be greatly appreciated if the general architecture of ``Channel``, ``Analyzer``, and ``Analysis`` objects is maintained. You can read more about the organization and functionality of these objects [here](https://cellocity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#cellocity-architecture).
