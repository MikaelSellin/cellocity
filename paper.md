# Summary

Studying the coordinated movement of confluent cells can give insigths in to may different biological phenomena, such as wound healing, cancer metastasis, and host responses to bacterial infections. Such experiments can collectively be termend confluent cell dynamics. Confluent cell dynamics is most often investigated by analyzing time lapse images generated by live cell microscopy. Thanks to recent developments in cell biology it is now possible to genereate tissue-like arrangements of primary cells, aslo known as organotypic culture or organoids. However, one disadvantage of such systems is that it is currently very laboursome to generate fluorescently labeled live samples, which makes optical flow based analysis of bright field (black and white) microscopy images the primary method to extract information from these systems. Because the study of confluent cell dynamics lies at the intersection of biophysics and cell biology, two communities with very different emphasis on mathematics, there is a need for simple an easy to use framework that performs and visualizes optical flow analysis.


# Statement of need

To date, optical flow and PIV analysis of microscopy data has primarely been done by different plugins for ImageJ, such as [PIV analyser](https://imagej.net/PIV_analyser) or via  MATLAB scripts `[@Vig2016]`. However, because PIV av optical flow are commonly used in the fields of fluid dynamics `[@Taylor2010]` and computer vision `[@Bradski2000]`

Cellocity is an bioimage analysis tool for quantifying confluent cell dynamics written in Python. It has been developed to be a "one-stop-shop" for researchers interested in investigating cell dynamics. Cellocity allows users to test different underlying analysis algorithms, packages, and parameters, such as comparing OpenPIV `[@Taylor2010]` and optical flow, and visualizations where crucial image metadata is always retained.


The main advantages of Cellocity is its ability work on unlabeled Brightfield time lapse microscopy data, and its ability to both quantify and visualize abstract optical flow analysis to the user. Cellocity aims to make optical flow based analysis of microscopy data easier by providing a framework that keeps track of image metadata, performs common pre-processing steps, and implements previously published analysis algotithms. The architecture of Cellocity is designed to be highly customizable and modular. Implementing new analysis modules, image readers, and visualizations is straight forward with the help of Cellocity's developer guide and API.
