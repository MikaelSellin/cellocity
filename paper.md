#Summary

Cellocity is an bioimage analysis tool for quantifying confluent cell dynamics written in Python. The main advantages of Cellocity is its ability work on unlabeled Brightfield time lapse microscopy data, and its ability to both quantify and visualize abstract optical flow analysis to the user. Cellocity aims to make optical flow based analysis of microscopy data accessible to a wide user base.
